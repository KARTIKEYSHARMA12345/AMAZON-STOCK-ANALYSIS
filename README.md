# AMAZON-STOCK-ANALYSIS
TIME BASED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Through this project, I gained practical experience in financial analysis using Python. I learned how to:

Work with multi-year stock data and calculate returns, volatility, and the Sharpe Ratio.

Apply time series forecasting using ARIMA models to estimate future stock prices.

Perform valuation using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and Price-to-Earnings (P/E) methods.

Interpret financial metrics to form investment insights, similar to real-world analyst workflows.

This project deepened my understanding of how data-driven tools are used in investment banking and equity research, and strengthened my skills at the intersection of finance and programming.
